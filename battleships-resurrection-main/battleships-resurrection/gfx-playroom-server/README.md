Just quickly made server from scratch to support multi-room game based on GFX technology, without any extra features,
all Java sources as in 2001.

I have adapted build process for [maven build tool](https://maven.apache.org/) so that just start maven with `mvn` in
the root. If you want start built server just from maven then use `mvn exec:java`
